# Technical Debt Tracker

## Project: Vibe Dev Squad Official
**Last Updated:** December 24, 2024

---

## Current Technical Debt: MINIMAL âœ…

### Phase 0 Assessment
- **Overall Status:** Clean foundation with minimal technical debt
- **Code Quality:** High (fresh project with modern dependencies)
- **Architecture:** Well-structured from the start
- **Dependencies:** Up-to-date with 0 vulnerabilities

---

## Potential Future Debt Areas

### High Priority (Address in Phase 1)
*None currently identified*

### Medium Priority (Monitor)
1. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Current: Basic .env.local setup
   - Future: Consider environment-specific configurations
   - Timeline: Phase 2-3

2. **Testing Coverage**
   - Current: Testing framework installed but no tests written
   - Future: Implement comprehensive test suite
   - Timeline: Start in Phase 1

### Low Priority (Future Phases)
1. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - Current: Using all dependencies as needed
   - Future: Tree-shaking optimization, code splitting
   - Timeline: Phase 3-4

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Current: No monitoring setup
   - Future: Add performance tracking
   - Timeline: Phase 4+

## Debt Prevention Strategies

### Code Quality Gates
- [ ] ESLint rules enforced
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks (future)
- [ ] Code review process (future)

### Architecture Principles
- Follow SOLID principles
- Keep components small and focused
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Document complex business logic

### Dependency Management
- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checking
- Bundle size monitoring

---

## Review Schedule

### Weekly Reviews
- Check for new ESLint errors
- Monitor dependency vulnerabilities
- Review code complexity metrics

### Monthly Reviews
- Assess architecture decisions
- Update dependency versions
- Review performance metrics

### Quarterly Reviews
- Major refactoring opportunities
- Technology stack evaluation
- Technical debt prioritization

---

## Notes
- This is a new project starting with best practices
- Focus on preventing debt rather than resolving it
- Regular monitoring will catch issues early
- Team education on clean code practices is key
