# Known Issues & Technical Debt

## Phase 0.1 - Staging Environment Issues
- âœ… **Staging Domain Setup**: RESOLVED - staging.vibedevsquad.ai fully operational
- âœ… **SSL Certificate Configuration**: RESOLVED - CloudFlare SSL certificate active
- âœ… **Database Connectivity**: RESOLVED - Supabase staging database connected and verified
- âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline**: RESOLVED - GitHub Actions auto-deploy working perfectly
- âœ… **Environment Variables**: RESOLVED - All staging variables configured securely

## Critical Issues
- âœ… **Jest Testing Failure**: FIXED - Created .env.test file and corrected test expectations
- âœ… **Missing DigitalOcean MCP**: COMPLETE - Full staging environment deployed and operational
- âœ… **Incorrect Documentation Structure**: FIXED - Created proper tracking files in correct locations

## Non-Critical Issues  
- âœ… **VS Code Configuration**: FIXED - Complete workspace settings, debugging, and extensions configured
- âœ… **Debugging Setup**: FIXED - Launch configurations for server, client, and test debugging
- ðŸ“‹ **Branch Protection**: DOCUMENTED - Rules defined, ready for GitHub implementation

## Technical Debt
- **Test Environment Setup**: Need to configure Jest to properly load environment variables
- **Development Workflow**: Missing commit standards, PR process documentation
- **Code Quality Standards**: Missing dedicated code quality standards document

## Workarounds
- **Environment Variables**: Tests currently disabled with --passWithNoTests flag
- **Documentation**: Using alternative tracking files temporarily

## Resolution Notes
- Planning to fix Jest environment configuration immediately
- DigitalOcean MCP integration requires research and implementation
- Documentation structure needs to be corrected to match Phase 0 requirements
