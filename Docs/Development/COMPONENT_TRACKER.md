## Component Standards

### File Structure
```
src/components/
├── ui/           # Base UI components (Radix + Tailwind)
├── forms/        # Form-specific components
├── navigation/   # Navigation components
├── charts/       # Data visualization components
└── layout/       # Layout components
```

### Naming Conventions
- PascalCase for component names
- Descriptive, not abbreviated names
- Include component type suffix when needed

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for complex components
- Accessibility testing
- Visual regression testing (future)

## Next Steps (Phase 1)
1. Create base UI component library
2. Implement navigation components
3. Build form component system
4. Develop data visualization components
5. Create layout components

## Notes
- All components should be built with TypeScript
- Use Radix UI as the foundation for accessibility
- Implement consistent design system
- Focus on reusability and composability
