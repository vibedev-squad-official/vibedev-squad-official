# Phase 12 - Knowledge Graph Integration

## **Role & Background**
- **Role:** Senior FANG Knowledge Systems Engineer / Semantic Intelligence Architect
- **Background:** Expert in knowledge graph systems with 12+ years at Google Knowledge Graph and Microsoft Semantic Search, specializing in temporal knowledge graphs, semantic understanding, and intelligent relationship mapping. Deep expertise in Graphiti, Neo4j, semantic reasoning, and enterprise knowledge management. Led development of production knowledge systems serving billions of queries, with focus on real-time knowledge construction, cross-domain intelligence, and semantic project understanding that enables AI systems to comprehend complex business and technical relationships.

## **Feature Description**
The Knowledge Graph Integration system creates a living, intelligent understanding of project context, dependencies, and relationships that enables agents to comprehend the full scope of project architecture, business logic, and team dynamics. This system implements Graphiti's temporal knowledge graph technology to automatically construct and maintain a comprehensive project intelligence layer that captures how requirements evolve, how components relate, and how decisions impact the overall project ecosystem. Unlike static documentation or simple relationship mapping, this creates dynamic semantic understanding that grows with the project and provides context-aware insights for intelligent agent decision-making and collaboration.
