Led development of production research platforms serving millions of queries daily, with focus on intelligent information synthesis, visual planning interfaces, and seamless integration with AI agents for autonomous research and project planning.

## Feature Description
The Planning Canvas & Research Hub serves as the visual intelligence interface for the Vibe DevSquad platform, providing comprehensive collaborative workspace for planning projects, conducting autonomous research, and organizing knowledge. **Critical Integration**: This phase seamlessly integrates with Phase 5.5 Planning Agent Core Engine to provide the visual interface and MCP-powered research capabilities that enable the Planning Agent to perform meticulous, autonomous research comparable to human-level analysis. The system implements a complete planning solution with interactive React Flow canvas, MCP-powered research automation (Perplexity, Browser, Context7), knowledge graph generation, real-time collaborative editing, and advanced visualization tools with comprehensive performance optimization.

Building upon Phase 5.5 (Planning Agent Core Engine), this system provides the Planning Agent with sophisticated research capabilities through MCP integrations, enabling autonomous web research, documentation analysis, and intelligent information synthesis. **Planning Agent Integration**: The Planning Agent uses this interface to conduct research sessions, create visual project plans, organize findings, and present comprehensive project analysis to users through an intuitive, collaborative canvas interface.

**Key Research & Planning Features:**
- **MCP-Powered Research Engine**: Autonomous research through Perplexity, Browser, and Context7 MCPs with intelligent task creation
- **Interactive Planning Canvas**: React Flow-based visual planning with drag-and-drop elements and real-time collaboration
