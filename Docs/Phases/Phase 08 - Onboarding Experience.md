# Phase 08 - Onboarding Experience

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Conversational AI Engineer / Voice Interface Architect Profile**: Senior engineer from Google/Amazon/Meta with 10+ years experience building conversational AI systems, voice interfaces, and real-time communication platforms like Google Assistant, Alexa, and Meta's video calling infrastructure. Expert in LiveKit agents framework, WebRTC real-time communication, natural language processing, intelligent conversation design, and multi-modal AI interactions. Deep experience with voice AI pipelines, video streaming, conversation state management, and building personalized onboarding experiences that intelligently configure complex systems based on natural conversation.

## Feature Description
The Onboarding Experience creates a revolutionary conversational onboarding system featuring "Vibe" - our AI planning agent powered by LiveKit's real-time voice and video technology. Instead of traditional form-based onboarding, users engage in natural conversation with Vibe through high-quality video chat, creating an immersive, personalized experience that intelligently configures their entire development environment. Building upon Phase 02 (Authentication System), Phase 03 (Agent Management System), Phase 04 (Task Management), Phase 05 (MCP Registry), and Phase 06 (IDE Integration), this system uses advanced conversation design to discover project requirements, team structure, technical preferences, and workflow needs. Vibe analyzes responses in real-time to automatically configure optimal agent teams, technology stacks, integrations, and development workflows. The experience includes ultra-low latency video streaming (100-200ms), natural voice synthesis, intelligent question routing, real-time configuration preview, and seamless platform setup. This transforms onboarding from a tedious process into an engaging conversation that creates immediate value and strong user engagement.
