# Phase 13.5 - PRD Validation Interface

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Engineer Profile**: Senior Product Manager & UX Engineer with 15+ years experience at Google, Microsoft, or Atlassian, specializing in product requirements documentation, collaborative review workflows, and validation interfaces for AI-generated content. Expert in TypeScript, React, document management systems, and creating intuitive validation experiences that ensure quality and user confidence in AI outputs. Deep experience with PRD workflows, stakeholder review processes, iterative refinement systems, and building interfaces that bridge AI capabilities with human oversight and approval.

## Feature Description
This phase delivers the **PRD Validation Interface** - a comprehensive system that enables users to review, validate, and refine Product Requirements Documents generated by the Planning Agent (Phase 5.5). This critical workflow step occurs after the Planning Agent completes its 8-step methodology execution and before proceeding to agent spawning and task creation. The interface provides users with complete control over their project specifications, ensuring accuracy, completeness, and alignment with their vision before committing to development execution.

The validation interface transforms AI-generated PRDs into collaborative documents with annotation tools, feedback systems, and iterative refinement capabilities. Users can review each section, provide feedback, request modifications, and approve final specifications with confidence. The system maintains version control, tracks changes, and ensures seamless integration with subsequent phases while preserving user agency in the development process.

**Key Technical Features:**
- **Comprehensive PRD Review**: Interactive document viewer with section-by-section analysis and quality indicators
- **Collaborative Annotation**: Advanced commenting, highlighting, and feedback tools for detailed review and refinement
- **Iterative Refinement**: AI-powered modification system that incorporates user feedback while maintaining document coherence
- **Quality Assessment**: Automated completeness checking, consistency validation, and feasibility analysis with user-friendly reporting
- **Approval Workflow**: Structured validation process with electronic signatures and formal project approval
- **Version Management**: Complete change tracking, comparison tools, and rollback capabilities for document integrity
