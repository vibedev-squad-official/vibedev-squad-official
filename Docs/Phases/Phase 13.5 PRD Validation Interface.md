# Phase 13.5 - PRD Validation Interface

## **Role & Background**
- **Role:** Senior FANG Product Manager & UX Engineer / Document Validation Specialist
- **Background:** Expert in product requirements documentation with 15+ years experience at Google, Microsoft, and Atlassian, specializing in collaborative review workflows, validation interfaces, and AI-generated content oversight. Deep expertise in TypeScript, React, document management systems, and creating intuitive validation experiences that ensure quality and user confidence in AI outputs. Led development of enterprise document validation platforms with focus on PRD workflows, stakeholder review processes, iterative refinement systems, and building interfaces that bridge AI capabilities with human oversight and approval.

## **Feature Description**
The PRD Validation Interface delivers a comprehensive system that enables users to review, validate, and refine Product Requirements Documents generated by the Planning Agent (Phase 5.5). This critical workflow step occurs after the Planning Agent completes its 8-step methodology execution and before proceeding to agent spawning and task creation. The interface provides users with complete control over their project specifications, ensuring accuracy, completeness, and alignment with their vision before committing to development execution. The validation interface transforms AI-generated PRDs into collaborative documents with annotation tools, feedback systems, and iterative refinement capabilities that maintain user agency in the development process.

## 🔥 **Important Instructions**

**CRITICAL: Before starting any tasks, read these files to understand current project state:**
- `current_status.md` - Current project state and active features
- `known_issues.md` - Existing bugs and technical debt  
- `changelog.md` - All previous changes and updates
- `features.md` - Completed, in-progress, and planned features

**Essential Requirements:**
1. Check off each subtask with [x] as you complete it
2. Do not proceed to the next task until ALL checkboxes in the current task are marked complete
3. **🔥CRITICAL🔥**: Use Magic UI MCP with `/ui` command for ALL component generation
4. Use Context7 MCP to fetch up-to-date documentation before starting each subtask
5. Use Perplexity MCP for any research needs or best practices
6. **Build Upon Phase 03**: Base Dashboard Foundation provides UI framework and routing
7. **Build Upon Phase 5.5**: Planning Agent provides PRD generation and modification capabilities
8. Use Supabase MCP for all database operations and real-time subscriptions
9. Implement fully functional features with no mock data
10. **Document Validation**: Complete review workflow with collaborative annotation and approval
11. **Electronic Signatures**: Legal compliance with audit trails and verification

**Design System Reference:**
- Reference `/Users/dallionking/Vibe Dev Squad/Docs/design/VibeDevSquad Design System 2025.md` for all UI styling
- Reference `/Users/dallionking/Vibe Dev Squad/Docs/design/Vibe DevSquad Landing Page Copy.md` for content and messaging
