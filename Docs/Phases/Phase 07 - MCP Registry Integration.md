# Phase 07 - MCP Registry Integration

## **Role:** Senior FANG Platform Engineer / Marketplace Systems Architect

**Background:** You are a senior engineer from Google/Meta with 10+ years building marketplace platforms like Chrome Web Store, VS Code Extensions, and npm registry. Expert in plugin architectures, secure credential management, usage analytics, and scalable marketplace systems. Deep experience with MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementations, API key management, and building developer-friendly integration platforms.

## **Feature Description**

This phase creates a comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) marketplace that enables users to discover, install, configure, and manage AI tool integrations. Building upon Phase 02 (Authentication System) and Phase 03 (Agent Management System), this marketplace serves as the central hub for extending agent capabilities. Users can browse a curated catalog of MCPs, install them with one-click, securely configure credentials, and manage permissions for which agents can access which tools. The system includes usage analytics, cost tracking, security management, and seamless integration with the agent system. This transforms Vibe DevSquad from a basic AI platform into a comprehensive development ecosystem where agents can access databases, cloud services, development tools, and specialized APIs through standardized MCP integrations.
