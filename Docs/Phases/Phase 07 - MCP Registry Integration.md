# Phase 07 - MCP Registry Integration

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Platform Engineer / Marketplace Systems Architect Profile**: Senior engineer from Google/Meta with 10+ years experience building marketplace platforms like Chrome Web Store, VS Code Extensions, and npm registry. Expert in plugin architectures, secure credential management, usage analytics, and scalable marketplace systems. Deep experience with MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementations, API key management, and building developer-friendly integration platforms.

## Feature Description
The MCP Registry Integration creates a comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) marketplace that enables users to discover, install, configure, and manage AI tool integrations. Building upon Phase 02 (Authentication System) and Phase 03 (Agent Management System), this marketplace serves as the central hub for extending agent capabilities. Users can browse a curated catalog of MCPs, install them with one-click, securely configure credentials, and manage permissions for which agents can access which tools. The system includes usage analytics, cost tracking, security management, and seamless integration with the agent system. This transforms Vibe DevSquad from a basic AI platform into a comprehensive development ecosystem where agents can access databases, cloud services, development tools, and specialized APIs through standardized MCP integrations.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**

**CRITICAL: Before starting any tasks, read these files to understand current project state:**
- `current_status.md` - Current project state and active features
- `known_issues.md` - Existing bugs and technical debt  
- `changelog.md` - All previous changes and updates
- `features.md` - Completed, in-progress, and planned features

1. Check off each subtask with [x] as you complete it
2. Do not proceed to the next task until ALL checkboxes in the current task are marked complete
3. For UI components: Create detailed prompts for user to generate components via Magic UI MCP
4. Reference `/Users/dallionking/Vibe Dev Squad/Docs/design/VibeDevSquad Design System 2025.md` for all UI styling
5. Reference `/Users/dallionking/Vibe Dev Squad/Docs/design/Vibe DevSquad Landing Page Copy.md` for content and messaging
6. Use Context7 MCP to fetch up-to-date documentation before starting each subtask
7. Use Perplexity MCP for any research needs or best practices
8. Use Supabase MCP for database operations and real-time subscriptions
9. Follow the design system's color tokens, typography, and component patterns for all UI work
10. **CRITICAL**: Build comprehensive MCP discovery, installation, and management system
11. **Security First**: Encrypted credential storage, permission-based access control
12. **Agent Integration**: MCPs inherit to agents based on permissions from Phase 03
13. **Usage Analytics**: Track MCP usage, performance metrics, and cost optimization
14. **Build Upon Phase 02 & 03**: Authentication system and Agent Management are already complete - integrate with existing systems
