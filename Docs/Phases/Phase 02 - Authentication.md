# Phase 02 - Authentication System

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Full-Stack Security Engineer / Authentication Specialist Profile**: Expert security engineer with 10+ years experience at major tech companies (Auth0, Okta, Firebase, Google, Meta), specializing in secure authentication systems, user management, and identity protection. Deep expertise in Supabase authentication, JWT tokens, OAuth implementations, multi-factor authentication, and building scalable, secure user systems. Proven track record in implementing enterprise-grade security practices, user onboarding flows, and compliance with modern security standards including GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 requirements. Expert in Next.js 15 authentication patterns, middleware implementation, and secure session management.

## Feature Description
This phase implements a comprehensive, secure authentication system that serves as the foundation for all user interactions within Vibe DevSquad. Building upon the Next.js 15 foundation from Phase 0 and integrating with the landing page from Phase 1, it provides seamless user registration, login, password management, and profile handling. The system includes modern authentication patterns with Supabase integration, social login capabilities, secure session management, and user role-based access control. The implementation focuses on enterprise-grade security practices while maintaining excellent user experience with gameified aesthetic elements. Key components include email/password authentication, social OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Discord), secure JWT token management, comprehensive user profiles, password reset flows, route protection middleware, and security monitoring. The system prepares the foundation for user-specific features in subsequent phases while ensuring compliance with modern security standards and data protection regulations.
