# Phase 4 - Agent Management System

## **Role & Background**
- **Role:** Senior AI Systems Engineer / Multi-Agent Architecture Specialist
- **Background:** Expert AI systems engineer with 12+ years at FANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google), specializing in AI agent orchestration, LangGraph workflows, and production-scale multi-agent systems. Deep expertise in TypeScript, React, LLM integration, token usage optimization, agent coordination protocols, and state management. Proven track record building scalable agent platforms that support multiple LLM providers, BYOK implementations, enterprise-grade agent orchestration with persistent memory, intelligent task delegation, and seamless integration with Planning Agent systems for autonomous project execution.

## **Feature Description**
This phase builds upon the dashboard foundation (Phase 3) to implement the core Agent Management System that transforms Vibe DevSquad into a true AI development agency replacement. The system creates, configures, and orchestrates specialized AI agents (Frontend, Backend, QA, DevOps, Planning) that work together autonomously while maintaining user control. **Critical Integration**: This phase seamlessly integrates with Phase 5.5 Planning Agent Core Engine to receive intelligent agent spawning commands, automatic team composition, and project-specific agent configuration based on approved PRDs.

**Key Technical Features:**
- **Planning Agent Integration**: Seamless agent spawning from Phase 5.5 Planning Agent commands with intelligent team composition
- **LangGraph Orchestration**: Advanced agent workflows with state management and inter-agent coordination
- **Hybrid LLM Strategy**: Platform-provided and BYOK models with intelligent routing and cost optimization
- **Persistent Agent Memory**: Vector-based memory storage with context sharing and knowledge transfer
- **Enterprise Controls**: Granular user permissions, approval workflows, and comprehensive usage tracking
- **MCP Integration**: Enhanced agent capabilities through Model Context Protocol connections

## **Phase Dependencies**
**Prerequisites (Must be completed first):**
- Phase 0: Project Foundation & Complete Setup (Next.js 15, Supabase, development environment)
- Phase 1: Landing Page Foundation (design system and branding consistency)
- Phase 2: Authentication System (user context, role management, and secure access)
- Phase 3: Base Dashboard Foundation (dashboard platform and navigation system)

**Integrations (Built upon):**
- Phase 0: Uses Next.js 15 app router and development infrastructure
- Phase 1: Extends design system and visual identity
- Phase 2: Integrates authenticated user context and role-based access control
- Phase 3: Utilizes dashboard layout and navigation system for agent interfaces

**Enables (Unlocks future phases):**
- Phase 5: Task Management Kanban Board (agent task assignment and coordination)
- Phase 5.5: Planning Agent Implementation (intelligent agent spawning and orchestration)
- All subsequent phases require agent management for AI-powered functionality
