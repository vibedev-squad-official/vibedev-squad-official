# Phase 04 - Agent Management System

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG AI Systems Engineer / Multi-Agent Architecture Specialist Profile**: Expert AI systems engineer with 12+ years experience at major tech companies (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Meta), specializing in AI agent orchestration, LangGraph workflows, and production-scale multi-agent systems. Deep expertise in TypeScript, React, LLM integration, token usage optimization, agent coordination protocols, and state management. Proven track record building scalable agent platforms that support multiple LLM providers, BYOK implementations, enterprise-grade agent orchestration with persistent memory, intelligent task delegation, and seamless integration with Planning Agent systems for autonomous project execution. Expert in vector databases, agent memory management, cost optimization strategies, enterprise security controls, and real-time agent performance monitoring across complex multi-agent environments.

## Feature Description
This phase builds upon the dashboard foundation (Phase 3) to implement the core Agent Management System that transforms Vibe DevSquad into a true AI development agency replacement. The system creates, configures, and orchestrates specialized AI agents (Frontend, Backend, QA, DevOps, Planning) that work together autonomously while maintaining user control. Critical Integration: This phase seamlessly integrates with Phase 5.5 Planning Agent Core Engine to receive intelligent agent spawning commands, automatic team composition, and project-specific agent configuration based on approved PRDs. Key technical features include Planning Agent integration with seamless agent spawning from Phase 5.5 commands and intelligent team composition, LangGraph orchestration with advanced agent workflows and state management, hybrid LLM strategy supporting platform-provided and BYOK models with intelligent routing and cost optimization, persistent agent memory using vector-based storage with context sharing and knowledge transfer, enterprise controls with granular user permissions and approval workflows, and comprehensive MCP integration for enhanced agent capabilities through Model Context Protocol connections.
