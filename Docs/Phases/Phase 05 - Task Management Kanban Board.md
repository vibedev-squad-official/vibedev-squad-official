# Phase 05 - Task Management Kanban Board

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Backend Engineer / Enterprise Project Management Specialist Profile**: Expert backend engineer with 12+ years experience at major tech companies (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Meta), specializing in enterprise project management systems, Jira-like functionality, and scalable task management architectures. Deep expertise in TypeScript, Next.js, real-time collaboration systems, advanced reporting, and building comprehensive project management platforms that handle complex workflows, sprint management, and enterprise-grade analytics. Proven track record with agile methodologies, workflow automation, time tracking, Planning Agent integration for autonomous task creation, and building systems that support both technical and business users with AI-powered project orchestration. Expert in epic/story hierarchy management, custom field systems, advanced filtering with JQL-like capabilities, release management, and enterprise-scale reporting with business intelligence features.

## Feature Description
The Task Management Kanban Board with Enterprise Features serves as the comprehensive project management hub of the Vibe DevSquad platform, providing Jira-like functionality with advanced features including epic/story hierarchy, sprint management, advanced reporting, workflow customization, time tracking, and enterprise-grade analytics. Critical Integration: This phase seamlessly integrates with Phase 5.5 Planning Agent Core Engine to receive automatic task creation, sprint planning, and project structure from approved PRDs, transforming manual project setup into intelligent automation. Building upon Phase 04 (Agent Management System), this system enables sophisticated project coordination between AI agents and human team members with features comparable to enterprise tools like Jira, Linear, and Asana. Planning Agent Integration: Tasks, epics, and sprints are automatically created and assigned based on Planning Agent analysis, with intelligent workload distribution and agent capability matching. Key enterprise features include Planning Agent integration with automatic task creation and sprint planning, epic/story/subtask hierarchy with multi-level organization and dependencies, sprint management with velocity tracking and burndown charts, advanced reporting with comprehensive analytics and custom dashboards, workflow customization with custom statuses and automation rules, time tracking with work logging and productivity analytics, release management with version planning and deployment coordination, custom fields with project-specific metadata and flexible data models, advanced filtering with JQL-like query language and saved filters, and AI-powered optimization with intelligent task prioritization and bottleneck detection.
