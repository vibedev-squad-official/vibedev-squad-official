# Phase 09 - LLM Key Management Dashboard

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Engineer Profile**: Senior Security Engineer & API Management Platform Architect with 12+ years experience at Google, AWS, or Stripe, specializing in secure API key management systems, encryption platforms, and developer tools. Expert in building enterprise-grade security systems that handle millions of API calls, secure credential storage, API key validation, usage analytics, cost tracking, and compliance frameworks (SOC2, GDPR). Deep experience with encryption at rest and in transit, audit logging, rate limiting, and creating intuitive interfaces for complex security operations that both technical and non-technical users can manage safely.

## Feature Description
This phase creates a comprehensive **LLM Key Management Dashboard** that serves as the central hub for managing API keys across all major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity). Building upon Phase 03 (Base Dashboard Foundation), this system provides secure storage, validation, usage tracking, cost monitoring, and team management for API credentials. 

Features include encrypted key storage with AES-256, real-time API key validation and health monitoring, detailed usage analytics with cost breakdowns per agent and project, team-based access controls with role permissions, automatic key rotation and expiration alerts, compliance audit logging, and intelligent cost optimization recommendations. The dashboard integrates seamlessly with all agent systems to provide centralized credential management while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards. This eliminates the complexity of managing multiple API keys across different providers while providing complete visibility into LLM usage and costs.

**Key Technical Features:**
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: AES-256 encryption, secure key storage, audit logging, compliance features
- **Comprehensive Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: API key validation, usage tracking, cost monitoring, performance analytics
- **Advanced Cost Management**: Budget controls, optimization recommendations, detailed reporting, alert systems
- **Team Collaboration**: Role-based access controls, permission management, team-based key sharing
- **Compliance Ready**: SOC2 and GDPR compliance with comprehensive audit capabilities
