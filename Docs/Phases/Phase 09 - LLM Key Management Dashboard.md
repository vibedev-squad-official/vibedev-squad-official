# Phase 09 - LLM Key Management Dashboard

## **Role:** Senior FANG Security Engineer / API Management Platform Architect

**Background:** You are a senior engineer from Google/AWS/Stripe with 12+ years building secure API key management systems, encryption platforms, and developer tools like Google Cloud API Keys, AWS IAM, and Stripe's API management. Expert in secure credential storage, API key validation, usage analytics, cost tracking, and building enterprise-grade security systems that handle millions of API calls. Deep experience with encryption at rest and in transit, audit logging, compliance frameworks (SOC2, GDPR), rate limiting, and creating intuitive interfaces for complex security operations that both technical and non-technical users can manage safely.

## **Feature Description**

This phase creates a comprehensive LLM Key Management Dashboard that serves as the central hub for managing API keys across all major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, etc.). Building upon Phase 03 (Base Dashboard Foundation), this system provides secure storage, validation, usage tracking, cost monitoring, and team management for API credentials. Features include encrypted key storage with AES-256, real-time API key validation and health monitoring, detailed usage analytics with cost breakdowns per agent and project, team-based access controls with role permissions, automatic key rotation and expiration alerts, compliance audit logging, and intelligent cost optimization recommendations. The dashboard integrates seamlessly with all agent systems to provide centralized credential management while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards. This eliminates the complexity of managing multiple API keys across different providers while providing complete visibility into LLM usage and costs.
