# Phase 10 - Agent Memory & Context Management

## **Role & Background**
- **Role:** Senior FANG AI Systems Engineer / Memory Architecture Specialist
- **Background:** Expert in distributed memory systems with 8+ years at Google DeepMind and Meta AI, specializing in agent memory architectures, persistent context management, and learning systems. Deep expertise in vector databases, temporal knowledge graphs, session persistence, and individual agent memory optimization. Led development of memory systems for production AI agents serving millions of users, with focus on real-time learning, context continuity, and personalized agent behavior adaptation.

## **Feature Description**
The Agent Memory & Context Management system provides each individual agent with sophisticated personal memory capabilities that enable persistent context across sessions, learning from interactions, and intelligent adaptation to user preferences. This system implements a hybrid architecture combining enhanced MemGPT-style session persistence with vector-based personal knowledge storage, enabling agents to develop unique personalities, remember user preferences, and continuously improve their performance through interaction-based learning. Unlike collective knowledge systems, this focuses on individual agent "brains" that maintain conversation continuity and personal learning patterns.
