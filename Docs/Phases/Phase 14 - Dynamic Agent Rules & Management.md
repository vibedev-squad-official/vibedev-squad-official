# Phase 14 - Dynamic Agent Rules & Management

## **Role & Background**
- **Role:** Senior FANG Governance Engineer / Business Rules Architect
- **Background:** Expert in enterprise governance systems and business rules management with 12+ years at Amazon Web Services Governance and Google Cloud Policy Engine, specializing in hierarchical rule systems, natural language processing for rule definition, and AI-powered rule optimization. Deep expertise in business rules engines (Drools, DecisionRules), approval workflow systems, and enterprise compliance frameworks. Led development of production governance platforms managing millions of rules across global organizations, with focus on user-configurable agent behavior, multi-level approval processes, rollback capabilities, and seamless integration with AI agent orchestration systems that enable business users to define complex agent behaviors through natural language while providing technical users with advanced code-based rule configuration.

## **Feature Description**
The Dynamic Agent Rules & Management system creates a comprehensive governance platform that enables users to configure agent behavior, constraints, and workflows through intuitive interfaces ranging from natural language rule definition to advanced code-based settings. This system implements a hierarchical rule structure (Global → Project → Agent Type → Individual) that allows for granular customization while maintaining organizational consistency. Unlike static configuration systems, this creates intelligent rule management that leverages AI to optimize rule definitions, ask clarifying questions, and provide recommendations for improved agent performance. The system integrates seamlessly with Phase 10 Agent Memory (rule awareness and learning), Phase 11 Multi-Agent Orchestration (rule-based coordination), and Phase 13 Project Logging (rule compliance tracking) to create a unified governance layer that transforms business requirements into executable agent behaviors with proper approval workflows, rollback capabilities, and comprehensive audit trails.
