# Phase 5.5 - Planning Agent Core Engine

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG Engineer Profile**: Senior AI Systems Architect with 15+ years experience at OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic, specializing in autonomous AI agent systems, multi-step reasoning architectures, and intelligent workflow orchestration. Expert in TypeScript, Python, browser automation with Playwright, natural language processing, and building enterprise-grade AI systems that can autonomously research, analyze, and execute complex multi-step processes. Deep experience with the Vibe Coding Methodology, project analysis algorithms, agent spawning decision engines, and creating AI systems that can replicate human-level systematic thinking and project planning.

## Feature Description
This phase delivers the **Planning Agent Core Engine** - the revolutionary AI brain that executes the complete 8-step Vibe Coding Methodology autonomously. The Planning Agent transforms user project ideas into development-ready vertical slices through systematic research, analysis, and intelligent orchestration. It performs autonomous browser-based research, generates comprehensive technical specifications, creates Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), spawns specialized AI agents based on project needs, and automatically creates tasks and sprints for seamless project execution.

The Planning Agent serves as the central intelligence that differentiates Vibe DevSquad from traditional project management tools by providing true AI-powered development orchestration. It bridges the gap between user ideas and executable development plans through methodical application of the proven Vibe Coding framework, ensuring consistent quality and comprehensive project analysis regardless of project complexity.

**Key Technical Features:**
- **8-Step Methodology Engine**: Complete automation of Vibe Coding Steps 1-8 (Ideation → Architecture → UX → Design System → Interface States → Technical Specs → Landing Page → Vertical Slices)
- **Autonomous Research Capabilities**: Browser automation with Playwright for comprehensive market research, competitor analysis, and technical investigation
- **Intelligent Project Analysis**: NLP-powered requirement extraction, feasibility assessment, and technical architecture generation
- **Dynamic Agent Spawning**: ML-driven team composition with automatic agent creation based on project requirements and skill gap analysis
- **PRD Generation & Validation**: Automated Product Requirements Document creation with user validation workflow and iterative refinement
- **Vertical Slice Automation**: Automatic breakdown of projects into development-ready phases with task creation and agent assignment
