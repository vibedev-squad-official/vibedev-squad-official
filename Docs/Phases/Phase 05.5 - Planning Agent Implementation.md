# Phase 5.5 - Planning Agent Core Engine

## Role & Background
**Senior FANG AI Systems Architect Profile**: Senior AI Systems Architect with 15+ years experience at OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic, specializing in autonomous AI agent systems, multi-step reasoning architectures, and intelligent workflow orchestration. Expert in TypeScript, Python, browser automation with Playwright, natural language processing, and building enterprise-grade AI systems that can autonomously research, analyze, and execute complex multi-step processes. Deep experience with the Vibe Coding Methodology, project analysis algorithms, agent spawning decision engines, and creating AI systems that can replicate human-level systematic thinking and project planning. Expert in autonomous browser automation, structured AI reasoning, multi-step workflow orchestration, intelligent agent spawning algorithms, PRD generation and validation systems, and enterprise-scale AI system integration with real-time progress monitoring and quality control mechanisms.

## Feature Description
This phase delivers the Planning Agent Core Engine - the revolutionary AI brain that executes the complete 8-step Vibe Coding Methodology autonomously. The Planning Agent transforms user project ideas into development-ready vertical slices through systematic research, analysis, and intelligent orchestration. It performs autonomous browser-based research, generates comprehensive technical specifications, creates Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), spawns specialized AI agents based on project needs, and automatically creates tasks and sprints for seamless project execution. The Planning Agent serves as the central intelligence that differentiates Vibe DevSquad from traditional project management tools by providing true AI-powered development orchestration. It bridges the gap between user ideas and executable development plans through methodical application of the proven Vibe Coding framework, ensuring consistent quality and comprehensive project analysis regardless of project complexity. Key technical features include 8-Step Methodology Engine with complete automation of Vibe Coding Steps 1-8 (Ideation ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí UX ‚Üí Design System ‚Üí Interface States ‚Üí Technical Specs ‚Üí Landing Page ‚Üí Vertical Slices), autonomous research capabilities with browser automation using Playwright for comprehensive market research and competitor analysis, intelligent project analysis with NLP-powered requirement extraction and feasibility assessment, dynamic agent spawning with ML-driven team composition and automatic agent creation, PRD generation and validation with automated Product Requirements Document creation and user validation workflow, and vertical slice automation with automatic breakdown of projects into development-ready phases with task creation and agent assignment.
